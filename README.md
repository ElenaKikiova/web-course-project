<h2>This is a project for an internal(for the time being) web-application for a shoe store.</h2>

Features which the app provides:
  - Keeping track of what shoes are there in the store
  - Storing information about the shoe supplier
  - Being able to rate the shoes(will be useful when the application is extended for customer usage) 
  - Specifying the brand and categories for the shoes.

Features for the future:
  - Implementing a user system with corresponding roles
  - Making a section for online shopping
  - Adding the possibility of local brands to request their products to be offered for sale in the web-site
 
To run the application locally:
  - Run a MS Sql server and in the appsettings.json specify the correct database connection
  - Provide atleast 1 shoe entry in the 'Shoes' table
  - Run the application with IISExpress
